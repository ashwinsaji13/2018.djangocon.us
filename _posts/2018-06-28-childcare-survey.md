title: "Talk to us about childcare!"
---

We’re always trying to make DjangoCon US more inclusive and welcoming to our attendees. We know from previous experience and from other conferences we admire that having on-site childcare can be a major factor in including attendees who would otherwise find DjangoCon US difficult to attend.

As we get ready for DjangoCon US 2018, we want to make sure we’re best serving our community, so we’re running a short survey on childcare availability at DjangoCon US.

Update: The survey is now closed. ~~Please [fill out the survey](https://goo.gl/forms/XVWe7R3Qb7ujQO3T2) by July 10.~~

Your responses will be completely anonymous, and we really want to hear what you think. Your answers help us make DjangoCon US better!

We hope to see you in San Diego!
